***Please note this is still a work in progress.***

### Appearance

Designed to be extremely minimal. Design and layout component architecture inspired by Material Design.

CSS uses native variables rather than SASS and also uses BEM class naming conventions.

### Technical

Does not use Flux style pattern but does use Context for simplicity's sake. This approach may not be appropriate in a real-world application.
